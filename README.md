Marketing Model to predict the customer lifetime value for Olist, a Brazilian E-Commerce Company.

Predicting the lifetime value for a company will allow stakeholders to make key decisions on when, how, and where money should be invested. With my analysis, stakeholders will be able to identify customers based on their most recent orders, most frequent, and the average monetary value; otherwise known as the RFM Matrix.

In the analysis, we will need to work on the features that will be fed into the model. Clusters will be created based on the features of the RFM matrix, which will be used to segment customers.

Machine Learning models used were the Logistics Regression for multi-class classification and then Linear Regression to predict the monetary value of the customers.
